# Database-and-SQL-in-IBM-Db2

This Project provides the idea how to load Database into IBM Db2 cloud and do exploratory Data analysis with three datasets. Here I used Structured Query Language (SQL) to

## Installation
This Project needs IBM Cloud Account, IBM Db2, Jupyter Notebook.

## File Description
The source code and Data are as follows:
- Final_Assignment_SQL.ipynb
- ChicagoCensusData.csv
- ChicagoCrimeData.csv
- ChicagoPublicSchools.csv

## Discussion
After completing this project, I understand how we can load Database into IBM Db2 and do necessary exploratory data analysis through SQL.
